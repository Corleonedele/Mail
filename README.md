# Mail
A tool to get email and attachment by specified string

i only test on windows with my own outlook email
i guess after cloning to your own computer you need set something about the outlook
you may be asked to log in SU account

that's all i guess, use it bravely cuz it won't send email

there's a department in code, that means the keyword you need to search in the email
